// Postbuild guard. Asserts that the stats_duck parser-extension WASM
// files made it into `dist/` after `vite build`. If they're missing,
// production VISUALIZE silently breaks: Cloudflare's SPA fallback
// serves `index.html` for the missing path, DuckDB-WASM fetches it,
// and reports "need to see wasm magic number".
//
// Failure modes this catches:
//   * `public/extensions/` got re-broadened in `.gitignore` and the
//     committed snapshot disappeared on a clean checkout.
//   * Someone accidentally `git rm`-ed the WASM files.
//   * A junction got deleted without committing the snapshot first.
//   * The build ran from a branch where the snapshot doesn't exist.
//
// Failure modes this does NOT catch:
//   * `@duckdb/duckdb-wasm` was bumped and DUCKDB_VERSION below wasn't
//     updated to match — keep the two in lockstep.
